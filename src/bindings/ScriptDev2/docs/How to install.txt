--- How to install ScriptDev2 ---

1) Install MaNGOS and compile it
2) Create a new folder under "src\bindings\" within the MaNGOS source called "ScriptDev2"
3) Checkout the ScriptDev2 trunk from "https://scriptdev2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scriptdev2"

4a) On Win32: 
 - Compile ScriptDev2 using the VC71 or VC80 project within the ScriptDev2 folder (this will overwrite the Mangoscript dll in the output directory)

4b) On Linux: 
- copy ScriptDev2 sources to mangos/src/bindings/ScriptDev2
- edit mangos/configure.ac, and copy/paste line "src/bindings/universal/Makefile" on next row, and then change to src/bindings/ScriptDev2/Makefile
- DO NOT DELETE IT! JUST COPY THAT LINE, AND MODIFY COPIED ONE, NOT ORIGINAL!!!
- close and save file
- run from command line:
-> ./reconf
-> autoconf
-> automake src/bindings/ScriptDev2/Makefile
- now configure and make, make install as usuall
- cd to src/bindings/ScriptDev2 and run commands:
-> make
-> make install

5) Execute the included "scripts.sql"
6) Run mangosd from your output directory
