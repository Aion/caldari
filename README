== Welcome to MaNGOS ==

MaNGOS (the Massive Network Game Object Server) is an Open Source reference
implementation for a MMORPG server system. Please see the file COPYING for
license details.

site at <http://www.mangosproject.org/>

Documenation on various development related topics can be found in the doc/
subdirectory, including Doxygen-generated API documentation.

The required SQL files for creating the database backend are included in the
sql/ subdirectory.

In order to build and install MaNGOS under Linux, follow the instructions
described in the INSTALL file. To build MaNGOS on Windows, please see the
win/ subdirectory. Project workspaces for Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual

In case you have checked out MaNGOS from the SubVersion repository, please run
./reconf prior to building, as you may otherwise not be able to run a build.
